From the Data Source (s) provided, build “a number of
dashboards” (static and dynamic) that will provide information in the following areas:
1. Daily, weekly, monthly performance KPIs (units and revenues) of Clinical staff:
- Units of Service provided by Fiscal Year
- Revenue generated by month – of the revenues generated how much is spendable and how much is
Denied? Across FYs
- Are there Duplicate Claims? If the are duplicates what is the resulting “real” revenue opportunity
- Quantify “true Denials” by reason – show revenue opportunities across the Fiscal Years
2. Of services generated, the value of Claimed versus Unbilled – for unbilled services, show what are the
reasons
